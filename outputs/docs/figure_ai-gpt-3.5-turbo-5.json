    "content": "OpenAI plans to build advanced humanoid robots after investing big in startups. A recent report by The Information suggests that OpenAI has internally discussed developing its own line of humanoid robots. According to TechCrunch, this report relies on information provided by two individuals with \u201cdirect knowledge\u201d of the discussions. Limited information is available about OpenAI's potential humanoid robot project. Specifically, the timeline for the robot's introduction and its intended applications remain uncertain. In 2021, OpenAI closed its robotics division, which halted its ambitions in that field. However, the company recently announced the re-establishment of its robotics research group after a three-year hiatus. If OpenAI were to re-enter the robotics space, it would face stiff competition from existing players. This ambitious move would place OpenAI alongside industry giants like Nvidia and Tesla, who are already heavily invested in this burgeoning field. Reportedly, the humanoid robot market is expected to grow significantly, reaching a projected value of $66 billion by 2032. Earlier this year in February, OpenAI participated in a $625 million funding round for Figure AI Inc. Figure AI's latest creation, the Figure 02 humanoid robot, leverages AI models developed with OpenAI's assistance. These partnerships could provide a valuable foundation for OpenAI's own robotic endeavors, and expedite the development process. Before its closure, OpenAI's robotics division achieved several significant research milestones, including successfully training a robotic arm to solve a Rubik's Cube and the open-sourcing of Roboschool, a suite of simulation tools for training robot AI. As per Reuters, OpenAI is collaborating with Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co to create an \u201cinference processor.\u201d This partnership could facilitate the development of a specialized chip optimized for powering the AI software within OpenAI's humanoid robots."

The robotics field has made large strides over the past few years with increasing advancements in AI and improving models, speeding up commercialization of robots largely in industrial settings, according to industry experts.\n\nGoogle\u2019s launch comes a month after robotics startup Figure AI exited its collaboration agreement with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI after it made an internal breakthrough in AI for robots. The search engine giant\u2019s Gemini Robotics is an advanced vision-language-action model that will have physical actions as a way to provide output. The second model, named Gemini Robotics-ER, will enable a robot to have an advanced understanding of the space around it and lets developers run their own programs using reasoning abilities offered by Gemini 2.0.\n\nGoogle said its models are designed for robots of all form factors including humanoids and other types used in factories and warehouses. Using robotics-focused AI models developed by the likes of Google and OpenAI can help cash-strapped startups reduce development costs and increase the speed at which they can take their product to market. Google said it tested the Gemini Robotics model on data from its bi-arm robotics platform, ALOHA 2, but can be specialized for complex use cases such as Apptronik\u2019s Apollo robot. Apptronik raised $350 million in a funding round last month led by B Capital and Capital Factory, with participation from Google to scale production of AI-powered humanoid robots. Google had bought robotics pioneer Boston Dynamics in 2013, and sold the company, known for its dog-like and humanoid robots, to SoftBank Group Corp about four years later."

The Lynx robot dog has been designed to access some of the Earth\u2019s most inhospitable locations. It was created by the Chinese company Deep Robotics to conduct search and rescue operations and help aid scientific exploration. And while it can roll over like any self-respecting pooch, it also has the ability to climb walls, snowboard and even swim.\n\nThe robot is helped by the possession of wheels instead of paws and its talents were recently showcased in a rather astonishing video. The Lynx can climb 8.7-inch steps and tackle 45-degree slopes. It also comes with an IP54 protection rating, meaning that it is suitable for use in all weather conditions. The product comes with an eye-watering price tag, however, and will set buyers back by \u00a314,520.65. And unlike traditional pooches, it has the limitation of battery life, which is three hours but can quickly be replenished with a replacement power bank.\n\nElsewhere in the world of robotics, one company has announced plans to ship 100,000 humanoid bots over the next four years. The news comes after Figure AI, who specializes in \u201cgiving artificial intelligence a body\u201d, signed a contract with BMW last year \u2013 their first commercial customer. The robot dog lasts just three hours before needing to be recharged. They currently have a \u201cfleet\u201d in the works for the brand, performing \u201cend-to-end operations\u201d \u2013 and it appears they are focused on expanding further. Founder of Figure AI, Brett Adcock announced they see the potential of shipping 100,000 \u201chumanoid robots\u201d over the next four years. The company has recently signed its second commercial customer, which Adcock doesn\u2019t name but describes as \u201cone of the biggest US companies\u201d. In an update on their work with BMW, Figure AI claims it to be an \u201cautonomous fleet\u201d operating 400% faster and with seven-times higher success rate than before. The company says its mission is to \u201cexpand human capabilities through advanced AI\u201d, citing \u201cunprecedented labor shortages\u201d across the US. A video shared on their YouTube channel shows a humanoid making a cup of coffee with a machine, after being vocally given the order by a staff member. In the clip, it says the robot \u2013 called \u2018Figure 01\u2019 \u2013 has \u201clearned to self-correct mistakes\u201d, such as not placing the coffee pod at the right angle."

    "content": "Humanoid robots: From science fiction to economic reality\nJanuary 09, 2025 at 10:33 am EST\nBy The editorial team\n\nHumanoid robots, long confined to science fiction stories, are now at the heart of a technological revolution thanks to advances in artificial intelligence (AI). These machines, capable of learning and adapting, promise to transform various industrial and societal sectors. This article explores the evolution of these automata, recent innovations, challenges and prospects for investors.\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence has made a quantum leap in the field of robotics. Robots can now learn by imitating, much as we do. Imagine a robot that watches a video of someone folding laundry and can then do the same thing, even if the conditions change a little.\n\nLast summer, Tesla boss Elon Musk announced that their Optimus humanoid robot could be on the market by the end of 2025. He even thinks it could boost Tesla's value to $25,000 billion.\n\nThe Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has launched a study group to examine the world of humanoid robots and establish standards that companies could follow. The group is open to academics, government agencies and industry players alike.\n\nBoston Dynamics presented the new version of its Atlas humanoid robot in April 2024. This model is fully electric, more powerful and more agile than its predecessor.\n\nAgility Robotics has collaborated with Manhattan Associates to integrate bipedal humanoid robots into warehouses.\n\nFigure.ai, a manufacturer of humanoid robots, joined forces with OpenAI in March 2024 to integrate OpenAI's AI into its robots.\n\nBeijing has decided to go all out on robotics with a $1.4 billion fund launched in August 2023. The idea is to boost technological innovation, advance commercial projects and support mergers and acquisitions in the sector.\n\nBut Canada is not to be outdone. At the end of 2022, the government invested $30 million in Sanctuary Cognitive Systems, a Vancouver-based company that manufactures versatile humanoid robots. Sanctuary Cognitive Systems has teamed up with Magna International to improve humanoid robots for automotive manufacturing. The partnership aims to make these robots more affordable and scalable, using Magna's engineering and manufacturing expertise.\n\nOn the military front, the use of ground combat robots capable of firing is no longer a science-fiction concept, but a reality in contemporary conflicts. Currently, during the war in Ukraine, alongside FPV aerial drones and naval drones, Ukrainian forces are deploying small wheeled robots equipped with machine guns against Russian troops. The Russians, meanwhile, have pioneered this field by deploying heavy Uran-9 robots in Syria, with apparently mixed results. The major military powers have all developed drones or machines which, although far removed from humanoids, incorporate automation and are capable of replacing certain human functions in high-risk missions.\n\nIn short, robotics is making great strides, and artificial intelligence is playing a key role in this revolution. Investments are pouring in, collaborations are multiplying, and innovations never cease to surprise.\n\nChallenges and growth prospects\nThe market for humanoid robots is booming. In 2023, it was already worth $2.43 billion, and could reach $66 billion by 2032, with annual growth of 45.5%, according to Forbes."

As high-profile corporations ranging from retailers like Amazon to carmakers such as Mercedes and BMW have announced humanoid pilots for factories and warehouses, conversations around worker safety are regularly buried beneath industry hype.\n\nOne Bay Area robotics firm, Figure AI, is hoping to correct that shortfall. They announced the building of a Center for the Advancement of Humanoid Safety, an in-house division wholly focused on the topic. Rob Gruendel, the former Amazon Robotics safety engineer heading up the project, revealed the plans via a LinkedIn post.\n\nEarlier factory and warehouse systems addressed the safety problem by caging in big, heavy robots. Subsequent solutions have turned to technology, including advanced computer vision, software developed by Veo Robotics, and a safety vest designed by Amazon to help keep robots from crashing into people.\n\nFigure AI is homing in on the gap in safety standards for humanoid robots. They have finalized a formal plan with an OSHA recognized independent testing laboratory to certify their robot's battery, functional safety control system, and electrical system to industrial standards.\n\nThe creation of the Center for the Advancement of Humanoid Safety is an important step in addressing safety concerns related to humanoid robots working alongside humans in factories and warehouses. The firm plans to publish quarterly updates offering more transparency around the safety testing procedures and fixes for potential hazards.\n\nHumanoid safety standards are set to become increasingly essential as more firms push to bring these robots into the home. The industry is preparing for the next big leap of bringing robots into domestic settings, and ensuring safety standards are in place is crucial for this transition."

    "content": "Meta Platforms is establishing a new division within its Reality Labs unit to develop AI-powered humanoid robots that can assist with physical tasks, according to an internal company memo viewed by Reuters on Friday. Facebook parent Meta is entering the competitive field of humanoid robotics, joining rivals such as Nvidia-backed Figure AI and Tesla, as the emergence of advanced AI models drives innovation in robotics and automation. In the memo, Meta Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth said the robotics product group would focus on research and development involving \"consumer humanoid robots with a goal of maximizing Llama's platform capabilities.\" Llama is the name of Meta's main series of AI foundation models, which power a growing suite of generative AI products on the company's social media platforms. \"We believe expanding our portfolio to invest in this field will only accrue value to Meta AI and our mixed and augmented reality programs,\" Bosworth wrote. The group will be led by Marc Whitten, the former CEO of self-driving car company Cruise, whom Meta has hired as vice president of robotics, Bosworth said in the memo. The news was first reported by Bloomberg News. Bosworth said the company also hired John Koryl as vice president of retail. Koryl, who was formerly CEO of second-hand e-commerce company The RealReal, was hired to expand efforts to sell directly to consumers Meta's Quest mixed reality headsets and AI wearables such as Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which Meta makes with eyewear maker EssilorLuxottica. Meta aims to build \"more direct expertise in the space\" by developing retail locations like the Meta Lab temporary store it opened in Los Angeles in November, although retail partners will continue to drive the bulk of hardware sales volume, Bosworth said. Meta did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The announcement represents a major bet on Meta's Reality Labs unit, which is aimed at developing technologies to drive future growth but has hemorrhaged money since its establishment. The unit lost about $5 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. Major tech companies and startups are pouring billions into developing AI-powered devices for manufacturing, logistics and household tasks. Progress on robots has been slow, however, as researchers have found that the language-related AI breakthroughs driving chatbot development have not necessarily helped with understanding of the physical world. Meta for years has been funding research into \"embodied AI,\" hoping to develop AI assistants that can look at, listen to and navigate the 3D physical world around them. The company's top AI scientist, Yann LeCun, also has been vocal about highlighting the limitations of language models and trying to develop new types of models that can better understand physical space. Prominent computer scientist Fei-Fei Li jumped into the race last year with the launch of her \"spatial intelligence\" startup World Labs, while Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said that his company's humanoid robot \"Optimus\" can perform many daily tasks and will eventually be sold to customers. On Thursday, Apptronik secured $350 million in funding backed by investors including Alphabet's Google to scale the production of its AI-powered humanoid robots designed for tasks in warehouses and manufacturing plants. Meta plans to develop its own humanoid robot hardware, initially targeting household chores, while aiming to create AI, sensors and software that can power robots manufactured and sold by various companies, according to the Bloomberg report. Meta has started discussing its plan with robotics companies, including Unitree Robotics and Figure AI, and does not immediately plan to launch its own branded robot, the report said.

    "content": "1X Technologies has debuted a humanoid robot called NEO Gamma. This humanoid robot can do everything at home, and it acts like a nanny that can attend to various needs of the household like cleaning, picking up laundry, and bringing items from one place to another. The robot features a 3D-printed nylon fabric skin-like finish that makes it stand out from other humanoid bots in the market.\n\n1X Technologies has been sharing new videos about its latest robotic development, the NEO Gamma, which features a soft \"skin\" that covers its exterior. The company explained that it was made from 3D-printed nylon fabric that covers its body, giving it less of a machine-like appearance that is more suited for the home. The design focuses on a minimalistic approach to its aesthetic that fits the home, and apart from its 3D-printed nylon fabric, it also features Emotive Ear Rings for improved communication.\n\nIn its demo video, NEO Gamma can help in vacuuming, watering the plants, carrying laundry, delivering items humans ask for, cleaning up at home, and a whole lot more. Robotics have evolved over the past years, and they are no longer the clunky, metal machines that were once the standard as they are now taking the likeness and capabilities of humans. Tesla's Optimus and Figure AI Inc.'s Figure 02 are examples of humanoid bots being developed to help people in various tasks and needs."

Now he\u2019s placing bets on these AI robotics companies.\n\nBefore Marko Bjelonic, co-founder and CEO of AI robotics company Swiss-Mile, met with billionaire Jeff Bezos last April, he sent Bezos his version of an Amazon 6-Pager to pitch his company, hoping it would improve his odds in a video call he expected to feel rushed\u2014but wasn\u2019t. The call led Bezos to co-lead a $22 million funding round in Zurich-based Swiss-Mile in August. Swiss-Mile is developing AI-powered robots that can deliver items from point to point.\n\nSwiss-Mile is one of at least nine companies that got investments from Bezos in 2024; seven of them are artificial intelligence startups, according to media reports, PitchBook and Preqin data and Forbes research. Bezos made investments in companies like Figure AI, Swiss-Mile, and Skild AI, focusing on AI-powered robotics, a vertical he had not publicly focused on as a venture investor before last year.\n\nBezos has personally invested in at least 108 startups across all industries since he first put $250,000 into Google in 1998. He has placed early bets on companies like Twitter, Airbnb, Uber, and Nextdoor, and continues to be actively involved in his venture portfolio.\n\nIn addition to robotics startups, Bezos also backed companies like controversial AI-powered search engine Perplexity AI, chip designer Tenstorrent, fintech firm Outgo, and caregiver support firm Magnolia. Bezos' investments in these companies reflect his interest in cutting-edge technologies and industries.\n\nOverall, Bezos' investments in startups show his continued interest in innovation and emerging technologies, as well as his strategic approach to diversifying his investment portfolio beyond Amazon."

According to a report from Bloomberg, Meta is planning to pour money into a new project to build AI-powered humanoid robots. Meta reportedly plans to start the project by building a robot capable of completing household chores. The effort will be headed up by Marc Whitten, who was serving as CEO of self-driving car company Cruise before resigning earlier this month. Whitten\u2019s team will fall under Meta\u2019s Reality Labs division, which is coming off a modest success with its Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta reportedly believes these bots are still several years away from being available, and that it\u2019s even farther out from being able to serve as the underpinning AI that will be used by robotics companies for their machines."

    "content": "Nvidia\u2019s \u2018Cosmos\u2019 AI Helps Humanoid Robots Navigate the World\nNvidia announced today it\u2019s releasing a family of foundational AI models called Cosmos that can be used to train humanoids, industrial robots, and self-driving cars. While language models learn how to generate text by training on copious amounts of books, articles, and social media posts, Cosmos is designed to generate images and 3D models of the physical world. During a keynote presentation at the annual CES conference in Las Vegas, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang showed examples of Cosmos being used to simulate activities inside of warehouses. Cosmos was trained on 20 million hours of real footage of \u201chumans walking, hands moving, manipulating things,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about generating creative content, but teaching the AI to understand the physical world.\" Researchers and startups hope that these kinds of foundational models could give robots used in factories and homes more sophisticated capabilities. Cosmos can, for example, generate realistic video footage of boxes falling from shelves inside a warehouse, which can be used to train a robot to recognize accidents. Users can also fine-tune the models using their own data. A number of companies are already using Cosmos, Nvidia says, including humanoid robot startups Agility and Figure AI as well as self-driving car companies like Uber, Waabi, and Wayve. Nvidia also announced software designed to help different kinds of robots learn to perform new tasks more efficiently. The new feature is part of Nvidia\u2019s existing Isaac robot simulation platform that will allow robot builders to take a small number of examples of a desired task, like grasping a particular object, and generate large amounts of synthetic training data. Nvidia hopes that Cosmos and Isaac will appeal to companies looking to build and use humanoid robots. Jensen was joined on stage at CES by life-sized images of 14 different humanoid robots developed by companies including Tesla, Boston Dynamics, Agility, and Figure. Along with Cosmos, Nvidia also announced Project Digits, a $3,000 \u201cpersonal AI supercomputer\u201d that can run a large language model of up to 200 billion parameters without the need of cloud services from the likes of AWS or Microsoft. It also announced its highly anticipated next-generation RTX Blackwell GPUs and incoming software tools to help build AI agents."

    "content": "Meta is reportedly working on humanoid robots that help with chores. Bloomberg reported on Friday that Meta plans to leverage its advances in AI and augmented reality to build a platform for futuristic humanoid robots that can help with household chores like folding laundry. Meta is reportedly creating a new team within its Reality Labs hardware division, which handles Quest VR headsets and the long-term Orion AR glasses project. Although it will build robot hardware during development, Meta\u2019s long-term goal is more like Android, where Google makes the software platform that almost all of the industry (outside of Apple) uses. Meta would make the underlying sensors, AI and software for other companies to put inside their hardware. In other words, it wants to be the Android of androids. At least initially, Meta plans to make household chores the project\u2019s central focus. Folding laundry, carrying glasses of water, putting dinnerware in the dishwasher, and other home chores are examples mentioned. Meta has reportedly held early discussions with the Chinese robotics company Unitree and California-based humanoid robot maker Figure AI. Meta Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth reportedly views the company\u2019s progress in hand tracking, low-bandwidth computing, and always-on sensors as advantages for developing humanoid robots. Last year, news broke that Apple and Google were also working on robotics. Flying cars may have to wait, but the idea of household robots like Rosey from The Jetsons is becoming more of a reality."

The human anatomy is very complex, and replicating such movement of the human body requires sophisticated hardware and design.\nThere is also the fact that humanoid robots that display human-like emotions and behaviors can lead to something called \"Cognitive Anthropomorphism\", which is when people attribute mental states to them that they do not possess. This could raise ethical dilemmas and unrealistic expectations. These are some of the challenges Meta will face in its work on humanoid robots.\nTwo companies are already in talks with Meta: Unitree Robotics and Figure AI Inc. The latter raised $500 million in funding from Microsoft and OpenAI last year. The field of humanoid robotics is already crowded with competitors like Tesla and its Optimus robot, Boston Dynamics and its Atlas robot, Samsung, and even Apple.\nMeta is not really known for its hardware expertise. Apart from its lineup of smart glasses and VR headsets, it does not seem to have much experience, especially given the existing competitors.\nHowever, Meta execs are optimistic about the company's chances, citing an advantage they believe Meta has over others, which is data and its vast experience with AI. Meta's CTO, Andrew Bosworth, said the following in a memo:\nThe core technologies we\u2019ve already invested in and built across Reality Labs and AI are complementary to developing the advancements needed for robotics.\nWhile Meta plans to build some of the hardware for its humanoid robots, it ultimately aims to be the Google of the robotics industry, offering the platform, software, sensors, and AI for other manufacturers to build their robots."

A fleet of 100,000 humanoid robots is set to shipped out over the next four years by a boundary-breaking artificial intelligence company - meaning your next co-worker just might be made of metal.\n\nA year ago, Figure AI signed with car manufacturer BMW and now has a \u201cfleet of robots performing end-to-end operations\u201d. Figure's CEO Brett Adcock announced on LinkedIn last month that the company had now signed another client, which was \"one of the biggest US companies\" and would give Figure the potential to ship the humanoids at high volumes.\n\nAdcock said that between BMW and Figure's new signing, he believes there is a path to \u201c100,000 robots over the next four years\u201d. He explained Figure is currently working on training the robots on carrying out work at high speeds and high performance.\n\nFigure, founded by Adcock in 2022, aims to deploy autonomous humanoid workers to support humans on a global scale. Its humanoid robot, called Figure 02, is AI-powered and self-reliant, and is described as being \u201cready to produce an abundance of affordable, more widely available goods and services to a degree which humanity has never seen\u201d.\n\nFigure 02 is 5ft 6ins, can run for five hours on a charge, and move at 1.2 metres per second. The machine combines the \"dexterity of the human form\" with \"cutting edge AI\" to be able to lend support across manufacturing, logistics, warehousing, and retail.\n\nThe robots are meant to eliminate the need for unsafe and undesirable jobs, Adcock explains, which he says will allow future generations to \u201clive happier, more purposeful lives\u201d. He writes on Figure\u2019s website that the company envisions a future where \u201chumanoid robots are the universal interface in the physical world\u201d.\n\nWhile the robots will perform corporate tasks in areas with \u201csignificant\u201d labour shortages and jobs that are unsafe or undesirable in the early days, in the long term, these humanoids could assist people at home, care for the elderly, or build new worlds on other planets, Figure says. Adcock was named on Time Magazine\u2019s list of 100 Most Influential People in AI in 2024 and told the outlet that the robot could perform 80 to 90 per cent of manual human tasks.\n\n\u201cEventually, physical labour will be optional,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll choose to do it, or you\u2019ll ask your Figure robot to do it\u201d."
